# pwr-gl2

**pwr-gl2** is a working name, we'll change it later, when we know what the
app is doing and come up with a fancy name.

## How to run

First, clone it, set up virtual environment and install requirements:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/boryszef/pwr-gl2.git
$ cd pwr-gl2
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the `config.ini` file with key of our app (not included in the repo)
and run:

```
python app.py
```
